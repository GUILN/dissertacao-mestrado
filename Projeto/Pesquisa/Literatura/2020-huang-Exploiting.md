## Method

**Description:** 
The method takes the current anonymous session $S$ and cross session information as input and predict the next Item: $V_{s, n+1}$ 

- BCS Graph:
	- The session sequence is transformed into a weighted directed graph $G_s = (V_s, E_s), G_s \in G$ where $G$ is the set of all session graphs
	- The edge set $E_s$ represents all directed weighted edges where the weight of the edge is given by the frequency of the occurrence of that edge within the session.
	- For the `self-attention` they used #WGAT 
	- If a node does not contain a `self loop`, a `self loop` is added to that node due to authors saying that it is common for the a user to click more than once in a product consecutively.
	- After converting the session $S$ into a graph $G_s$ the final embedding of the session is based on the calculation of this session graph $G_s$. 
	- Construction:
		- Every single session is converted into a graph $G_s$ 
		- A global graph $G_{gs}$ is generated by concatenating all $n$ edges set $\sum_{s = 0}^{n}{E_{s}}$ 
- FGNN - Full Graph Neural Network
	- It uses #WGAT - Weighted Graph Attention Layer
	- It uses Mask-Readout function to aggregate item embeddings being "distracted" by #cross-session information
- BCS - Broadly Connected Session
	- Converts a session into a graph with cross-session information

**What it proposes:**
Tries to address 2 problems:
1. Model complicated item dependency relationships to improve the item and session #embedding
2. Exploit and incorporate #cross-session information into the current session in the setting of anonymous session

## Results

|            | **Diginetica** | **Yoochose** |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **R@20**   | 51.67          | 71.75        |
| **MRR@20** | 18.74          | 32.45        |

## Conclusions

- The FGNN model utilizes a weighted graph attentional layer (WGAT) and a Readout function to learn representative features and the order of item dependency, respectively
- It is compared to non-GNN methods by the authors (which does not have much value)

## Free Notes

**Introduction:**
- Explains and shows the correlation (using Pearsons correlation) between sessions with at least one item in common is high (mean of 0.43), although it does not shares how the Pearson's coefficient was calculated
