## Method

**Description:** 

- FGNN - Full Graph Neural Network
	- It uses #WGAT - Weighted Graph Attention Layer
	- It uses Mask-Readout function to aggregate item embeddings being "distracted" by #cross-session information
- BCS - Broadly Connected Session
	- Converts a session into a graph with cross-session information

**What it proposes:**
Tries to address 2 problems:
1. Model complicated item dependency relationships to improve the item and session #embedding
2. Exploit and incorporate #cross-session information into the current session in the setting of anonymous session

## Experiments
#p_at_20 #MRR_at_20 - #Diginetica #Yoochoose 

## Metrics
#p_at_k #MRR_at_k

## Results

|            | **Diginetica** | **Yoochose** |
| ---------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **R@20**   | 51.67          | 71.75        |
| **MRR@20** | 18.74          | 32.45        |

## Conclusions

- The FGNN model utilizes a weighted graph attentional layer (WGAT) and a Readout function to learn representative features and the order of item dependency, respectively
- It is compared to non-GNN methods by the authors (which does not have much value)

## Free Notes

**Introduction:**
- Explains and shows the correlation (using Pearsons correlation) between sessions with at least one item in common is high (mean of 0.43), although it does not shares how the Pearson's coefficient was calculated
